    <h2>Traits:</h2>
    <b>Adept Machinist:</b>
    <p>The Tau have enjoyed success in large part due to their ever-developing and expanding technology. Although mostly the
        realm of the Earth caste, certain Fire Warriors feel a certain affinity to the weapons and gadgets they regularly
        employ and enjoy a superior understanding of such machines. Whenever a Tau Explorer who chose this Classified Competence
        assists an allied Tau character with a Tech-Use Tests, he grants a +20 bonus rather than the normal +10 bonus.</p>
    <b>For the Greater Good!:</b>
    <p>The Tau value the group over the self, and further trust their comrades and commanders to always choose the best course
        of action. This enables every Tau to follow orders without hesitation or doubt. Once per encounter, a Tau Explorer
        may gain a +10 bonus to a Test made while directly following an order from another Tau character. Additionally, if
        this order places the Explorer into substantial danger to benefit the group as a whole, this bonus increases to +30
        (GMâ€™s discretion).</p>
    <b>Non-Imperial:</b>
    <p>This character was not raised among humans, and knows little about the culture and history of the Imperium. The laws,
        traditions, religion, and superstitions of Mankind are unfamiliar and alien to characters with this trait.The character
        suffers a -10 penalty on all Common Lore, Forbidden Lore, and Scholastic Lore Tests relating to the Imperium of Man.</p>
    <b>Speak not unto the alien:</b>
    <p>This creature is a member of an alien species that is viewed with a mixture of fear and loathing, and different enough
        in form and thought as to make any kind of social interaction a greater challenge. This creature suffers a -20 penalty
        on all Fellowship-based Tests when dealing with humans, and imposes the same penalty on humans. These penalties do
        not apply when dealing with individuals who have become familiar with him. Finally, the presence of any xenos aboard
        a human vessel is unsettling for the crew. The continued presence of one or more xenos Explorers aboard a human ship
        reduces its morale by 2.</p>
